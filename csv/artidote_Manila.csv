"janeygermia","2018-08-23 01:54:40","Hi! Dr. Chris Alipio, through the Acute Psychiatric Unit of Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center in Marikina, offers FREE consultation on weekdays. Since the clinic is government-funded and -run, you would have to line up and secure a slot. Otherwise, you could also set an appointment for consultation in his private clinic in Tandang Sora, Quezon City for a fee. (I've been going to ARMMC since February and I only paid Php 100 for the OPD card. Lines are also bearable if you come early)

"natutulog","2018-08-24 11:56:48","If y'all don't want to talk to a person first, try visiting La Mesa Ecopark near Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City. Only PHP20 entrance fee if you have a student ID (40-50php regular fee). The park is so huge it has horses, a lake, a koi pond, swimming pools, and an orchid garden!!! Lots of trees and quiet spaces too. 👽 You can also visit the Facebook post (dated March 5, 2018) of the UP Diliman University Student Council where they posted their Mental Health directory for more resources (also available at tinyurl.com/USC-MHdirectory). 🐢"

She accepts walk-in clients but, to be sure, try to come by and agree on a schedule with her. She's there every Tuesday and Thursday, from 2-6pm. I worked with her from 2012-2015. She helped me recover from depression after I was severely abused by a former SO. She is also now the therapist of my current partner.”"

Maricar Fajardo (iambigthink@gmail.com) she is based in Makati/Taguig and i’ve been under her care for about over a year. She’s very easy to get along with, especially if you’re a young adult or a teen. Honestly, she’s helped me a lot and I wouldn’t be alive anymore if it weren’t for her.”"

She’s actually the 2nd psychiatrist I’ve had. I decided to transfer to her after having an underwhelming experience with my previous doctor, and I think it was one of the best decisions I ever made. She can help you in ways you won’t even think are possible and she’s very patient and understanding and non-judgmental. I highly recommend her. 🙂”"

I have not been in any therapy etc but I studying my Master’s degree in Psychology and one of my professors is simply the best — Dr. Constantine Della. You can easily google him. He’s a really good psychiatrist & therapist, and he’s really passionate about his work. He has lots of clinics but I think most of the time he’s in Philippine General Hospital. 😊”"
