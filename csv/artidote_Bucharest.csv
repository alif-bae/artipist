"ignat.valentina","2018-08-19 14:45:21","Hi there!
I recommend Adina Demian. Her website is adinademian.ro and there you will find all the information you need.
She has helped me deal with a lot of mental and emotional issues I have been through over the past few years, such as obsessive thoughts, anxiety, grief and depression. What I appreciated most in my experience was the fact the she gave me a healthy perspective when I didn‚Äôt have one and a lot of tools that helped me understand myself, grow and better navigate the difficult moments.
Lots of love! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"rramonette","2018-08-19 14:49:29","This is wonderful! As both a patient and a psychologist to be, I too found myself tormented by the quest most of us face when searching for professional help. Our national association is still trying to implement an efficient solution to deal with this issue. Baby steps though. To begin with, I strongly recommend this: www.istt.ro/home. The only centre in Ro for studying and treating trauma, which has amazing people as psychologists, personally & profesionally prepared to deal with all kinds of experiences that the human nature has been endowed to go through. Don't hesitate to contact me for more guidance if needed ‚ù§"

"anamariavictoria12","2018-08-19 15:53:02","I would recommend Elena Cozma. I went to a life coach course started by her, and we had a chance to talk about her experiences both as a therapist and life coach. You can find her contact at http://www.psihoterapieconfident.ro/."

"sonjinne410","2018-08-19 16:59:49","I recommend Diana Ioanes. When I was in high school we were given the option to try group self-development and that‚Äôs how she helped me realise that I want to study Psychology for uni. Finished my first year, couldn‚Äôt be happier. She has A LOT of experience in psychotherapy and is a genuinely good and professional person. dianaioanes_bf@yahoo.com http://www.despresuflet.ro/cabinete-psihologice/bucuresti/cabinet-individual-de-psihologie-ioanes-diana-bucuresti--608/"

dr Emilian Voiculescu.
i have lots of things going on in my life and i felt really comfortable telling everything to him without being judged. plus the clinic gives you a really good vibe."
"r1kalashnikov","2018-08-19 17:28:21","@r1kalashnikov he also knows about borderline personality disorder, which is not so common in romania...you wont find lots of therapists that know what you are talking about. so i was really happy when he mentioned it to me because someone could finally understand me."

"aura.maria","2018-08-20 10:58:13","Later edit: I realised I could have given more info so that my recommandation is trustworthy, useful and people can relate to it :) In my experience after two unsuccessfull encounters with 2 psychologists whose approach I found to be superficial or it just didn‚Äôt suit my way of relating to mental health, I met Mihaela Danaila from @mindwellnessinstitute who helped me deal with a lot of aspects in my life and very important gain and know there are other perspectives, always, when you are stuck, dealing with anxiety, depression or other sorts of imbalances. She helped me especially with self-criticism,the relationship I have with my mother and the loss-absence of my father, the later one being neglected for years before that. I appreciate the fact that she ‚Äúpreaches‚Äù the teachings of mindufullness and doesn‚Äôt seem to be the type of practitioner who gets stuck in ancient techniques but rather is open and very investigative about what she chooses to do with her clients. Like a doctor who does his research on new studies and is updated with the latest discoveries. That gives me a feeling of security and trust. She also gives therapy sessions via Skype so that‚Äôs an extra. Be well everyone! ‚úåüèª"

"crisandreimogos","2018-08-20 18:22:22","My recomandation is Valentina Neac»ôu, from Clinica Asist. She is a CBT therapist but her approach is eclectic, with this in mind, she is flexibile in her methods."

Also, talking to him about more personal issues was easy and comfortable. You could try reaching him using the following email address: ovidiu.popa-velea@umfcd.ro‚Äù"
"annaaamaria25","2018-08-20 22:04:02","My recommendation is Mr. Mihai Catalin. He is also a Psychology teacher in my high school. He is the best human being and also my best friend.

"theartidote","2018-08-25 14:51:06","Anonymous recommendation: ‚ÄúHi Jova! I'm from Bucharest and I would really like to recommend Keren Rosner, a therapist that helped me tremendously in a short period of time. She specializes in stress, anxiety and depression-related issues, as well as traumatic childhood events, but not only; she is very passionate about what she does so she is constantly researching and joining new courses so that she can have a thorough approach, while maintaining a very warm, human attitude as well. I used to suffer from really bad anxiety and mild depression and only going to her sessions for one year made me fix everything I was struggling with. I never thought I would be able to be so confident in myself and especially tone my emotions down and control them. Of course your page helped a lot as well, so I want to help others too :) I really wanted to make this recommendation because I know how important mental health is and this particular therapist gives amazing results and is so supportive..."

"malis810","2018-08-26 09:44:15","Hi, I'm not from Bucharest, though I would like to recommend a therapist from Arad. His name is Karol Julien Wild and I've met him 5 times, mostly in the past year and he's helped overcome so many things and also helped me answer many questions which were going on inside my head by that time. He's very friendly and respectful and I've learned many exercises related to self-help, self-esteem and dealing with your own negative emotions. He has surprised me so many timed with his intelligence, also he's really funny :). So if you are from Arad I definitely recommend him even if you're dealing with problems that do not seem so big."
