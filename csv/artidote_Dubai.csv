There are a lot of psychologists/therapist/psychiatrist in The Lighthouse they have also good and relaxing vibe in their clinics. They main reason why I just stopped going on therapy last year was because it was not covered with my medical insurance. Around 700 aed -800 aed per session, and I needed to go to therapy twice a month. But if they have med.insurance that covers mental health services it is a good center. ❤️”"

Before meeting her i was crying continuously for 2 years and found it hard to even get up and take a shower. I owe a lot to her for being.”"

"yasmi.en","2018-08-26 07:02:41","American Centre Of Psychiatry and Neurology has a psychiatrist named Dr. Nasser AlHindi in the Dubai branch. He was always kind and very honest with me, he helped me find the right combination of medicine for me, and I'm feeling better than ever. The only complaint I have is that to get a medical report from them costs 150. So transferring psychiatrists or traveling and going to a new psychiatrist will cost you some money to prove you have your diagnosis."

Give this a try because we have clients who tell us it helps them with their anxiety and depression. Also this therapy is specifically designed for PTSD and as a helping aid for addiction."
