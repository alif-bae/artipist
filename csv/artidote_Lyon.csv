"theartidote","2018-10-01 09:43:01","All of the cities I share come at the request of Artidotees from that area. And I understand that the success of this initiative relies on the number of people in that city who 1)follow/know about The Artidote and 2)have had an experience with a psychologist/therapist. There may be cities in which no resources can be retrieved due to the lack of those two points. But it‚Äôs all worth a try.

"lucierep","2018-10-04 21:28:16","I'm from Lyon too, although this post may not have many answers yet I'm sure its time will come ‚òÄÔ∏è I had a therapist a few years ago, her name is Ga√´lle Dibou (20 rue Joseph Serlin, 69001 Lyon). She is very sweet, likes to smile (I remember thinking it was too much for me back then haha). I couldn't say she is the best I've seen as I haven't seen any other ones, but she's far from being a bad therapist. üåø"

They match you with an intern in psychology, the interns are very well trained and you pay as much as you can (it's free but any financial contributions are appreciated as they fund the associations' activities and services)"
