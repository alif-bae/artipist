I have been seeing Psychotherapist Ipsa James for a while now. They are a queer friendly therapist with an eclectic approach of psychotherapy. They have been able to provide a supportive, open and positive environment for me, and I am sure for their other clients as well, to talk about deep seated issues without any judgement.
