I‚Äôve tried almost every other doctor here in Islamabad and I did not like any. They all had the same old lines to say to me which were the least bit effective. However Dr. Fareed was my favorite. He completely understood all I had to say and did not make me feel like I was overreacting. He‚Äôs super busy however so time is an issue.

"zizou_ten","2018-09-20 11:28:57","Dr. Yousuf Raza is your go-to man if you  need help. I'm sure there are other very professional psychiatrists too, but it's hard to believe there can be anyone better than him. He saved my life, there is no other way in which to put this. The way he so open mindedly communicates and how he listens is unparalleled. I knew he was the one to go to for help because I have been attending his seminars and talks which are conducted all over the twin cities on topics that require much needed attention. Despite that, it's hard to get yourself to open up, I get that. So before you book an appointment, you might just want to attend a seminar to see the way he communicates, that will be of great help. Just months ago I wasn't able to eat for 20 hours at a stretch yet kept vomiting during panic attacks. I felt the worst kind of purposeless-ness deeply rooted inside me and my mind was clogged. I have come a long, long way from there. I found my purpose, and I'm more productive than ever. I wish each and every one of you peace of mind, heart and soul. Whether you see Dr. Yousuf or not, I hope you get the right help, whatever works for you. It's the hardest battle to fight, but it's temporary. Once fought rightly, you'll feel invincible having made it to the other side. All said, I'm still recovering, but definitely heading in the right direction. God be with us all. 
Contact Dr. Yousuf on: 03313456723
For details on his upcoming seminars 1) Suffering with a smile and 2) Love unplugged visit the facebook page: http://www.thealchemists.pk/

Dr. Yousuf is available at Medicsi in Civic Centre, Phase 4, Bahria Town Islamabad for around 3 or 4 days a week and see's his clients at home as well in DHA2."
