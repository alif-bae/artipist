"hamathevegetarian","2018-08-30 11:45:48","Isa Rönsch, Rodenburgstraße 29, Tel: 03040574299... Not entirely sure whether or not she speaks English but a quick phone call should sort that out x she's very direct and down to earth, great if you like that kind of no nonsense attitude"

"rekvijem","2018-08-30 19:28:43","why is it preferable if the therapist is fluent in english? isn't it easier and also really important to express yourself in your native language?"
"theartidote","2018-08-30 20:39:11","@rekvijem Simply because The Artidote is a platform that posts only in English, so the community is mostly English-speaking. And Berlin is full of English-speaking expats and Artidotees who would preferably talk to someone in their native language"
"omniconscient","2018-08-30 22:09:40","I think it would be fair to also post some German therapists, since, like me, there might be many other artidotees looking for one in Berlin. 
Ich habe vor kurzem meine VT abgebrochen weil ich den Therapeuten nicht ernst nehmen konnte. Nach einem neuem Erstgespräch möchte ich nun eine Tiefenpsychologische Therapie anfangen. Bin für jeden Tip Dankbar 🙏"

"theartidote","2018-08-31 08:16:03","@omniconscient you’re absolutely right; from now on I will not make it a preference for them to be English speakers. There’s many people who follow the page for which English is not their first language and may benefit as well from resources in their native tongue. Thank you so much for that feedback! It allows me to make this project more inclusive and resourceful ❤️"
"omniconscient","2018-08-31 08:27:59","@theartidote thanks, I appreciate 🙏❤️"
