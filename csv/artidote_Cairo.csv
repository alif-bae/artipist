"theartidote","2018-08-28 11:34:38","Anonymous recommendation: “Dr. Amr Salaheldine 
His secretary number: ‭+20 100 6037149‬
This person helped me solve a main issue in my life.. just in 9 sessions! I went to three therapists before who were shitty and laughed at my stories.. yawned while i am talking
But Dr. Amr is a one of a kind human being
I recommend everyone and anyone to go see him!
He is such an interesting person and he even opens up to patients about himself 
I enjoy talking to him to the extent that I get excited to our appointment.”"
"theartidote","2018-08-28 11:35:08","“Also he gained a lot of experience. He used to work in England and decided to come to Egypt because there is a lack of good therapists in Egypt. Dr. Amr worked with different cases: children, criminals,rape victims, traumatized people and helped most of them to get over their problems.”"

"israfouda","2018-08-28 14:02:34","I was experiencing tremendous anxiety when I was living in Egypt. I would step out of my house and feel every little noise pierce through my brain, I would feel anxious from such small triggers. I saw her for about 6 months, and she was amazingly compassionate, kind, understanding, I think what really stands out about her is that you feel she genuinely cares about you. That really makes a difference because for me, it was a form of motivation to get better. I haven’t been to therapy in about a year as I don’t need it anymore but whenever I visit Egypt I make sure to have a check-up session with her! She’s better than therapists I’ve had in Europe. It’s hard to find good therapists in Cairo and she’s such a gem."

"marioumahh","2018-08-28 23:18:25","Nafs Clinic is great. Doctor Dalia Gamil is brilliant and compassionate and non-judgmental. She cares for her patients unlike most doctors in Egypt and actually calls if you miss your appointment. I've personally been to her clinic and she's been treating me for 7 months and I've never been in a better state of mind in my life. She's also treated some of my family members and friends. She's truly one of a kind. This is the clinic's number ""0106 3701706‬"""

She is a great  listener and never made me feel judged. I took the step to start therapy because I had terrible anxiety and OCD which was beginning to impact my life negatively. I spent a year and half going regularly to work through issues and have grown so much because of it. I am much more self aware, confident and have learnt to process emotions rather than suppress them. She is amazing!”"

"theartidote","2018-09-23 00:16:02","Submitted recommendation: “Heal counseling center in Heliopolis. It’s a great environment that has many great therapists especially dr. Noha Al Nahas who is the founder of the place. They create a very calming atmosphere so you can be able to talk freely, and they totally understand the stigma going around mental illness and they try their hardest to make everyone feel protected. They have helped many people I know and I think they’d be of a great help for anyone who needs professional help. •
Also here’s a link of their facebook page, you can also send them a message and they’ll get back to you shortly with all the information about each therapist available. They will provide all the info you need. https://www.facebook.com/healcounselingcenter/“"

I went first to Dr Nabil El ot and then continued with therapy in the same place with Dr Sally. 
I had depression and I am now fine. I’m off the meds after 1 year and a half. Dr Sally is excellent, she was very understanding and very caring.”"
