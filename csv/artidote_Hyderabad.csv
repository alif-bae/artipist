‚ÄúDr. Sujatha Rajamani from Kims hospital. Her contact number is +91 98480 43200. She helped me get through a lot of things and really puts forward an approach which helps you feel better, warmer. I‚Äôd highly recommend her.

Her appointment can be taken through calling the kims hospital.‚Äù"

She literally helped me get out of 4 years (or more) of depression. She worked with me through professional techniques and the results truly showed over time. She does charge for her sessions but if you're already one of her patients she always replies via text or call when you need her and she's free.
‚Ä¢
Most importantly she doesn't prescribe medication unless extremely necessary which i think is super important.‚Äù"

For anybody else that may read this message: when it comes to sharing the contact info of a trusted professional, a work email or website link will suffice. Please do not share phone numbers unless you‚Äôve received previous approval about sharing it on this platform. thank you :)"
