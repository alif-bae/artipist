"ques.era","2018-11-22 16:04:28","i've been seeing evelyn boon, a senior psychologist, at sgh's life centre clinic for almost 2 years now and she's really wonderful - she's supportive, funny, open-minded yet no-nonsense when the situation calls for it. the sessions with her have helped me a lot in terms of coming up with simple solutions for the day-to-day difficulties i face, even now."

"bloop.blob","2018-11-22 16:34:41","I really recommend:
- CHAT for free diagnoses & referrals to heavily subsidised counselling; although take note that a lot of young people go there so the waiting list and process might be long
- Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre for couples therapy, mediation, their individual counselling is good too, plus they're very generous about reducing the cost of treatment depending on your financial situation
- Psycare Consultants; private clinic (hence pretty expensive rates per hour) with good psychotherapists like Tan Yih Sze (the one I saw). most of the psychotherapists in this clinic are trained in specific therapy types to deal with ptsd/trauma/related addictive disorders/backgrounds of abuse, and they often have multilingual patients of a range of ages and backgrounds (mandarin/dialect-speaking, children, etc)
all of the above are LGBTQ-friendly, if that's a concern to you!"
"bloop.blob","2018-11-22 16:44:49","tips for finding professional help:
1) the process is usually long and not easy, but don't be discouraged if the first few counselors or therapists aren't the right chemistry fit. you might find that talk therapy is not for you, or that you don't want to take medication, or that you need both. all of that is fine. eventually you will get to somewhere with resources to help you in some way if you keep looking
2) if you more or less know your condition/diagnosis, look up the clinical specialisations of the therapists in public hospitals and private clinics to facilitate finding a therapist who's trained in the right kinds of therapy to treat you. ask around friends, look in more unlikely places like university psych clinics which might have cheaper fees (James Cook Uni, NUS CPS), get reviews from others on therapists/counsellors
3) proactively ask for a free first trial session through email or whatnot if you have to pay for the kind of therapy you're going for, so that if the therapist is a Hard No (discriminatory, insensitive, stigmatizing), you at least won't be paying them for a session you're technically not getting any therapy in"
"bloop.blob","2018-11-22 16:46:15","if you're LGBTQ and looking for resources on how to deal with that, DM me and I can try my best to link you to resources or groups that can help you out!!"
"daisyannemitchell","2018-11-22 16:49:08","omg Thank you!!!! i Needed this"
"bloop.blob","2018-11-22 16:51:45","also, psycare clinic deals with much more than trauma therapy stuff!! that's just a bit more uncommon so I felt I needed to highlight it. if you have depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc you'd get sufficient help too. it's just pretty expensive so I'd recommend Eagles if you're looking for fees on a sliding scale that still provides quality therapy"

"sandylyj","2018-11-22 20:01:14","I did a survey regarding why those struggling with their mental health aren‚Äôt seeking professional help and concluded two expected answers that Singaporeans will give. 
1) stigmatism, even though government hospitals are fairly affordable after it‚Äôs been subsidized, many people fear that no companies will hire them bc of the diagnosis shown in their medical report.

2) financial difficulties, private clinics will ensure confidentiality unlike gov hospitals but the con is the hefty price tag, some private clinics charge based on duration, not per hour but per minute. 
When both social stigmatism and financial issue combined, most Singaporeans will simply drop the idea of therapy. I personally chose to be treated from gov hospitals mainly because of their credibility, I believe that a good company will not be quick to judge and focus on individual‚Äôs skills and capabilities instead. Quick tip for Singaporeans that‚Äôll consider gov hospitals, visit any Polyclinic and ask for a referral to the hospital you prefer(some hospitals offers specialized disorders), a referral letter from Polyclinic will get you an earlier appointment slot in the hospital."
"a1exa100","2018-11-22 21:17:26","I went to SACAC counseling and my therapist was named Mahima Gupta and she helped me a lot after going through the hardest time of my life. Unfortunately I wasn't able to continue therapy with her because I moved and the cost was a lot, but if you can afford SACAC counseling, they have some of the best therapists."

"ferandaaa","2018-11-23 12:38:31","Dr Gan, psychologist from Child Guidance Clinic at NUH! I went when I was younger and he is amazing. Not only was he patient (I spent a good six months and six sessions not saying anything substantial), even when I grew too old for the clinic (they cater to children and so at 18 there was pressure to leave) he made sure to tell me I could continue seeing him, regardless. For children, fees are subsidised to $40 per session, you can book as and when you like (my doctor talked with me about what I felt comfortable with) and since it's under the govt there are more subsidies for those who need them. All in all it was a relief to be heard by him, and received warmly by a place that always cared"

He is highly professional and extremely approachable. Not once has he ever made me feel judged, which was not the experience I had with other Therapists/psychiatrists. Although I‚Äôve overcome my depression now, I make it a point to still see him because he never fails to help me gain a better perspective with whatever is happening in my life.
