"apraj1ta","2018-09-16 15:47:17","Dr. Pallavi Bhatnagar is good. Lucknow does not have much aid when it comes to mental health. A lot of clinical psychologists are available but good counsellors are less in number; but if someone wants to see a clinical psychologist Sweety Srivastava at Nirvan Hospital is good."

"saurabhpar","2018-10-22 15:35:33","@aabalkhulche @malvikasrivastava  we just had our first meetup in Lucknow this weekend for 'Honest Conversations over Coffee' partly focussed on mental health 
It's a  #meetup where we can have #Honest #Conversations & people enter without labels or legacy of their background, jobs, failures or successes. With just a mutual respect for the human in front of them.
It's an idyllic vision but if this connects with you, be there!
