"zwidawuzn","2018-09-09 11:23:12","@psychosistherapyproject is a low-cost specialist service for people experiencing psychosis. Extremely rare service in the U.K., as people living with psychosis usually don't get talking therapy treatment through the national health service (mostly only medication). Plus, it is open-ended or long-term therapy and therapists are extremely experienced or are undergoing specialist training. It's currently available at Islington Mind (referrals from all London boroughs) and Lambeth & Southwark Mind (only residents from the borough). I am a volunteer at the service in Islington where I used to run an art group (which has now been taken over by one of our service users, a talented self-taught artist) and, after qualifying as a counsellor/psychotherapist, also started providing therapy there. We have a lovely and supporting community that goes beyond the therapy room, especially our drop-in service, where we share food and company, is highly popular. The founder and clinical lead is an expert in the field of psychosis and is also speaking out to reduce the stigma of mental health, especially the stigma and popular myths surrounding psychosis that are prevailing in society but also within mental health institutions."

Louise applies queer feminist & anti-capitalist values in her work as a therapist. Felt like really having someone on my side, but who would also challenge me at the same time.”"

"imtribal","2018-09-10 07:56:52","@theartidote mental health problems are increasing. We don’t have data from the past but clearly it has increased in last 10 years. All this so called development and progress is happening and we are progressively getting ill also. Therapy will help but it won’t last for generations. So we need something else. Try @sadhguru"
