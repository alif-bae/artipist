In these situations, I\u2019d like to have a list of resources that I can refer them to. So I need the entire global community\u2019s support in the coming days, weeks & months as I share posts asking for recommendations for cities across the globe.\n\ud83c\udf38\nToday I\u2019m asking anyone in Bucharest, Romania to send in their recommendations based on their personal experience. \nTHANK YOU\n\u2764\ufe0f\nWe\u2019re all in this together, \n@jovaferreyra"

She helped me especially with self-criticism,the relationship I have with my mother and the loss-absence of my father, the later one being neglected for years before that. I appreciate the fact that she \u201cpreaches\u201d the teachings of mindufullness and doesn\u2019t seem to be the type of practitioner who gets stuck in ancient techniques but rather is open and very investigative about what she chooses to do with her clients. Like a doctor who does his research on new studies and is updated with the latest discoveries. That gives me a feeling of security and trust. She also gives therapy sessions via Skype so that\u2019s an extra. Be well everyone! \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

I used to suffer from really bad anxiety and mild depression and only going to her sessions for one year made me fix everything I was struggling with. I never thought I would be able to be so confident in myself and especially tone my emotions down and control them. Of course your page helped a lot as well, so I want to help others too :) I really wanted to make this recommendation because I know how important mental health is and this particular therapist gives amazing results and is so supportive...",
